    <h1>NO NO NO NO NO NO! DON'T BE AN <strong>IDIOT</strong>!</h1>
    Do you see "facebook.com" in the address bar? No, you don't. Don't ever type your login and password to Facebook on
    a site that isn't facebook.com. Same with Twitter. And LinkedIn. I guess what I'm trying to say here is, don't be
    an idiot.
